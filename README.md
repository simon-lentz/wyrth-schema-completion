Version 1.3.0

This extension provides a layer of code completion to facilitate the authoring of data stories in yaml. When a .yaml file is opened or created after installing the extension (search wyrth-schema-completion in the Visual Studio Code "extensions" button on left sidebar and install the extension published by simon-lentz) typing the letter of a node label will bring up an autocomplete option for the node, for example, typing an "E" will bring up the completion option for the "Entity" node. There are certain node fields that will have a red squiggly underline (error underline), these fields have multiple default values. By typing a colon after the underlined value (e.g. ownership -> ownership:) a popup menu will provide the list of values that the author should choose from!

To facilitate ease of use, the extension activates when opening or creating a yaml file (.yaml). For the time being, the only schema supported is the Electric Domain schema. In the future, multiple schemas may be accessed by the extension.
