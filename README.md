Version 1.0.0

This extension provides a layer of code completion to facilitate the authoring of data stories in yaml. When a .yaml file is opened or created after installing the extension (search wyrth-schema-completion in the Visual Studio Code "extensions" button on left sidebar and install the extension published by simon-lentz) typing the letter "E" will call a popup menu for the Electric Domain Manual Entry auto-completion. Hitting the enter or return key will fill the file with the schema default values. There are certain node fields that will have a red squiggly underline (error underline), these fields have multiple default values. By typing a colon after the underlined value (e.g. ownership -> ownership:) a popup menu will provide the list of values that the author should choose from!

To facilitate ease of use, the extension activates when opening or creating a yaml file (.yaml). For the time being, the only schema supported is the Electric Domain schema. In the future, multiple schemas may be accessed by the extension, there will also be support for multiple file types, like: .json or .cue.
