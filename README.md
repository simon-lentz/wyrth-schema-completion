This extension provides a layer of code completion to facilitate the authoring of data stories in the format defined by the domain model schema in use by Wyrth. This extension is a WIP.

To facilitate ease of use, the extension becomes active on opening of .yaml, .cue, and .json files. For all other tasks not involving authoring data stories, it is recommended to DISABLE this extension.
